# **Employee Reviews**

We take our existing employee reviews code and modify it to make an API (app.rb) using Sinatra. The corresponding test suite was also developed asserting each of the five assignment requirements are exposed to the web:

1. List Employees
2. Read a Single Employee
3. Create an Employee
4. Delete an Employee
5. Change the Name of a employee.
